**Last updated: February 4, 2026**

## Data Collection

This extension does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

## What data is stored

The extension stores the following data locally in your browser (chrome.storage.local):

- Subtitle text extracted from Udemy course lectures
- Course curriculum metadata (lesson titles, IDs, section names)
- Collection progress (current lesson index, running state)

All data is stored exclusively on your device and is never sent to any external server.

## Network requests

The extension makes requests only to:

- **udemy.com** — to fetch course curriculum via Udemy's API (using your existing session)

No data is sent to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or servers owned by the extension developer.

## Data sharing

This extension does not sell, transfer, or share user data with any third parties.

The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

## Data deletion

All stored data can be deleted at any time by clicking the "Reset" button in the extension panel, or by uninstalling the extension.
